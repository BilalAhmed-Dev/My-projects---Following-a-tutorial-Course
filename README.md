## This repo includes all projects that I have done following an internet tutorial.

## The good:
* All lines of code were written by me
* No copy - paste
* I have understood the logic
* I can implement the skills taught here in a real working environment
## The bad:
* The idea and design is not mine
* The apporach and logic were taught by an Instructor/Teacher and I did not come up with it myself
